            <h2>Geography & History</h2>
            Haiti is a country that is located in the caribbean sea, and it includes the western third of the island of
            Hispanoloa. Haiti shares this island with Dominican Republic. Due to Haiti's position on the edge of the
            plate, it's very untenable to earthquakes. Hayti means "land of the mountains" adopted from the indigenous,
            or native Taino language.

        The Native Americans that arrived from Central and South America have lived in Hispaniola since around 5000 B.C. These groups of early settlers included the Tanos. Upon explorer Christopher Columbus' arrival on the island in 1492 and his declaration of it as a Spanish colony, this made the island of Hispaniola an attractive place, and many Spanish settlers wanted the island. The Spanish settlers killed most of the natives on the island and took control of it as their own. By the 1600s, the colony had become known as Saint-Domingue and was ruled by the French. Haiti became a free state on January 1st, 1804 as a result of the Haitian Revolution, which was the first and only slave uprising that led up to the country's independence against French colonial rule, led by Toussaint Louverture.

          In late Feburary and early March, people in Haiti celebrated Carnaval, also known as "Kanaval" or "Mardi Gras"
          in Haitian Creole. During these days, the streets are filled with parades, dances, joy, comparasas, and
          costumes. People would wear traditional garments full of color and would disguise themselves as characters
          from pop culture.
